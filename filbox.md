‒ Project Name: Filbox

‒ Slack Channels: can't create right now (no permission?).

‒ Team Slack handles: yongxi.liu, kimmy.w, lea, felixzhou 

## (1) Brief Project Description

‒ Encrypt your file and choose your storage miner! Filbox is an open source file storage encryption application that is designed to enable millions of users to easily encrypt their files and upload it to the distributed network. Powered by IPFS, Filbox adds an extra layer of convenience by providing the choices of storage miners to the end users so that users can choose the intended storage miners based on their preferences.

## (3) What does your application/UI do?

‒ Users can upload their files through the Filbox App and they will be able to choose from a list of eligible miners to store their files. Of couse, users get the choice of picking themselves as the miner as well.

‒ For users who are concerned with data privacy, we provide the encryption function to encrypt and decrypt private files.

‒ In the future, Filbox can take the role of a content sharing platform as well - users can also sell their original files in Filbox to get more Fils.


## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

‒ We are not using curated dataset for this project. 


## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

‒ We collect file that users are willing to upload, share and sell and that will be our major consideration.

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

‒ ~100T

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

‒ The data uploaded will be sealed by the miner and backed up into the IPFS network. Filbox will record user info, order & payment details, etc.,


## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

‒ Depending on user preferences, the data uploaded will be either encrypted or unencrypted.

## (9) What tech stack will you use to store the data?

‒ We will use Powergate and lotus.

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

‒ Users can retrieve data directly from IPFS or from Filecoin miners.

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

‒ Anyone who wants to use decentralised storage is our potential user. 

‒ Those who want to provide valuable data and earn Fils can also join us in the project.

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

‒ Yes, we have already had some early users from some of our existing projects. However, Filbox is still under development and we expect to gain more users as the project matures. 





## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

We will be keen to know:

‒ How to improve user experience, especially how to help new users to understand decentralised storage and make the most of it.

‒ Time constraints - what level of readiness do you expect the projects to be by the end of Slingshot.

‒ And of course, how to acquire users in a short time frame.
